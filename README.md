#  Assignment 3 â€“ Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python

This repository contains Python scripts for Assignment 3 of the Python course (Module 4), focused on functions and modules.

---

## Tasks Overview

###  Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python program that:

1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument.
2. Calculates the factorial using a loop or recursion.
3. Returns the calculated factorial.
4. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

**Expected Output:**

For example, if the function is called with `5`, it should return:

```
The factorial of 5 is 120
```


###  Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the `math` module to calculate:
   - Square root of the number
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.

**Expected Output:**

If the user enters `25`, the output should be:

```
Square root of 25.0 is 5.0
Natural log of 25.0 is 3.2188758248682006
Sine of 25.0 radians is -0.13235175009777303
```
